# She sells sea shells on the sea shore;
# The shells that she sells are sea shells I'm sure.
# So if she sells sea shells on the sea shore,
# I'm sure that the shells are sea shore shells.		19

# The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
# Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
# The first my thought, the other my desire,
# These present-absent with swift motion slide.
# For when these quicker elements are gone
# In tender embassy of love to thee,
# My life being made of four, with two alone,
# Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
# Until life's composition be recured,
# By those swift messengers returned from thee,
# Who even but now come back again assured,
# Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
# This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
# I send them back again and straight grow sad.		87

# Not much chance, completely cut loose from purpose,
# He was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to somewhere.
# And it began to snow.
# And the bus stopped at a little cafe in the hills and the passengers entered.
# And he sat at the counter with the others, and he ordered, the food arrived.
# And the meal was particularly good.
# And the coffee.
# The waitress was unlike the women he had known.
# She was unaffected, and there was a natural humor which came from her.
# And the fry cook said crazy things.
# And the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh.
# And the young man watched the snow through the window.
# And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever.
# The curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there.
# And it would always stay beautiful there.
# And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board.
# And the young man thought: “I’ll just stay here, I’ll just stay here.”
# And then he rose and he followed the others into the bus.
# He found his seat and looked at the cafe through the window.
# And then the bus moved off, down a curve, downward, out of the hills.
# And the young man looked straight forward.
# And he heard the other passengers speaking of other things,
# or they were reading or trying to sleep.
# And they hadn’t noticed the magic.
# And the young man put his head to one side,
# closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep.
# There was nothing else to do,
# just to listen to the sound of the engine,
# and the sound of the tires
# in the snow.		148
