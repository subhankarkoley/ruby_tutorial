# Multiply two matrices

# Given three positive integers m
# , n and r, m lines of n elements, giving an m×n matrix A, and n lines of r elements, giving an n×r matrix B, form the product matrix AB, which is the m×r matrix whose (i,k) entry is the sum
# A[i][1]∗B[1][k]+⋯+A[i][n]∗B[n][k]
# and print the result.
