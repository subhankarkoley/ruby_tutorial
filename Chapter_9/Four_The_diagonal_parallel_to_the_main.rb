# The diagonal parallel to the main

# Given an integer n, produce a two-dimensional array of size (n√ón) and complete it according to the following rules, and print with a single space between characters:

#     On the main diagonal write 0 .
#     On the diagonals adjacent to the main, write 1 .
#     On the next adjacent diagonals write 2 and so forth. 

# Print the elements of the resulting array.
