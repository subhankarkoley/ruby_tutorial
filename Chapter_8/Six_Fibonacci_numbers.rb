# Fibonacci numbers

# Given a non-negative integer n, print the nth Fibonacci number. Do this by writing a function fib(n) which takes the non-negative integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

# Don't use loops, use the flair of recursion instead. However, you should think about why the recursive method is much slower than using loops.
