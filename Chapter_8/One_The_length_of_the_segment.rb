# The length of the segment

# Given four real numbers representing cartesian coordinates: (x1,y1),(x2,y2). Write a function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) to compute the distance between the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Read four real numbers and print the resulting distance calculated by the function.

# The formula for distance between two points can be found at Wolfram.
