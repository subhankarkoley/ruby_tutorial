# Lost card

# There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost. Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.

# Given a number N, followed by N âˆ’ 1 integers - representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N). Find and print the number on the lost card.
